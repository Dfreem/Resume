Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer Intern position at U.S. Xpress. As a current computer programming student at Lane Community College, I have gained experience in developing software services using modern programming languages like C#, Python, and JavaScript. I am confident that my skills and passion for tackling hard problems make me a strong candidate for this role.

During my time as a computer programming tutor, I have honed my ability to communicate effectively with team members, which I believe is crucial in any software engineering position. I have experience working with Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains IDEs to develop software applications that are scalable, performant, and reliable. Additionally, my proficiency in Git and Jira Software allows me to work efficiently in an agile development environment.

In terms of my qualifications, I am constantly learning new technologies and have a solid understanding of professional software engineering practices. As someone with experience in developing software services and an understanding of design for scalability, performance, and reliability, I am thrilled at the prospect of working on the tools that power U.S. Xpress's freight platform. I believe my skills in languages such as C#, Python, and JavaScript, as well as my proficiency with a range of tools and technologies like SQL Server, MySQL, and Azure Data Studio, make me well-suited to playing a pivotal role in shaping the definition, design, and development of the systems at U.S. Xpress.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you about my qualifications and enthusiasm for this position.

Sincerely,

Devin Freeman
