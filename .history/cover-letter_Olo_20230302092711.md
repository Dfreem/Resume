<br />Dear Olo Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineering Intern position that was posted on your website. The opportunity to work with such a passionate and intelligent team dedicated to delivering products using modern tools and technologies, is an ideal fit for me. I am confident that my experience and education in computer programming and my natural curiosity will allow me to excel in this internship position.

As a computer programming tutor at Lane CC, I have collaborated with students and enhanced their comprehension of computer programming languages and concepts. Additionally, as a server administrator and creator for the Discord community, Let's Code, my addition to the team would bring along my experience in team networking and communication, and a strong sense of virtual team-building and support.

Furthermore, I have experience producing markdown documentation for software projects using tools such as GitHub and VisualStudioCode for production or hosting. This skill has allowed me to effectively communicate technical information to team members and stakeholders in a clear and concise manner. I believe that this experience, coupled with my strong work ethic and passion for software development, would make me a valuable addition to the Olo team.

Thank you again for your time and consideration. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
<br />
Devin Freeman
