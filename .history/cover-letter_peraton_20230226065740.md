Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Systems Engineer Intern position available through Peraton's Internal Research & Development (IRAD) program for the summer of 2023. As a rising junior in Lane Community College's Computer Programming program, I believe my skills and experiences make me a strong candidate for this role.

In my previous experience as a Computer Programming Tutor, I have worked to improve students' comprehension of programming languages and concepts. As an Administrator and Creator of the Let's Code Discord Server, I have collaborated with peers and created a space for programming students to receive tutoring and work together. Through these experiences, I have developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills, as well as the ability to quickly adapt and learn new technologies and concepts.

In addition, my proficiency with programming languages such as C#/.NET, Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS, as well as my exposure to software engineering processes, make me well-suited for this role. I have also worked with various tools and technologies such as Visual Studio, Docker, Azure Data Studio, and GIT, and have experience with databases such as SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, and Azure SQL.

I am confident that my self-motivation, independence, attention to detail, and responsibility will make me a valuable addition to the team. As a remote intern, I am also capable of working independently and have experience collaborating with others through online platforms such as Discord.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your team and further develop my skills and career.

Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
Devin Freeman
