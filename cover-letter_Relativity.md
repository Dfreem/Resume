<br />Dear Relativity Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to apply for the Software Engineer Intern position at Relativity. The opportunity to work with an innovative team, use cutting-edge technologies, and gain hands-on experience in building scalable and dynamic web systems, is an ideal fit for me. I am confident that my passion for web development, desire to work in an Agile environment, and my strong team player mindset will enable me to contribute to Relativity's mission.

As a computer programming tutor at Lane CC, I have collaborated with students and enhanced their comprehension of computer programming languages and concepts. Additionally, as a server administrator and creator for the Discord community, Let's Code, my addition to the team would bring along my experience in team networking and communication, and a strong sense of virtual team-building and support. Additionally, I have a keen eye for detail and can document code additions and issues using MarkDown and other markup languages.

Moreover, I am excited about the opportunity to work on Relativity's highly distributable systems composed of multiple database, processing, and web servers. The chance to participate in the SCRUM process and collaborate with a diverse team to develop meaningful solutions, aligns with my career aspirations.

Thank you for considering my application for the Software Engineer Intern position at Relativity. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the organization's growth and success while expanding my knowledge and skills.

Sincerely,
<br />
<br />
<br />
